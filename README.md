# Updated Professional Portfolio

Our task this week was to update our professional portfolio's that we created previously in week 2. In this task, we need to add our first student project, and two homework tasks that we've done throughout the year, as well as links to those projects. We also had to update our GitHub profiles, resumes as well as our LinkedIn profiles.
